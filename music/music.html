     The music i love the most is Nigerian music because it makes
     me connect back to my root. We have different musicians 
     like Davido, Kiss Daniel, wizkid, Teckno, Flavor, Dare, Olamide.
     The artist i love his song the most is Olamide. 
     I love his selection because i can relate to his music 
     and it makes me feel that the song is about me the music 
     makes me see the  richness of my culture and assurance that
    with determination, you can achieve whatever you want in lif
